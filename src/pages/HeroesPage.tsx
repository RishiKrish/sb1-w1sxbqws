              While history remembers the leaders, the rebellion of 1857 was sustained by thousands of anonymous participantsâ€”sepoys who refused orders, villagers who harbored rebels, merchants who provided supplies, and ordinary people who chose to fight rather than submit to colonial rule.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              These unsung heroes came from all castes, religions, and regions, temporarily setting aside differences to unite against a common adversary. Their collective sacrifice laid the groundwork for the later independence movement and demonstrated the power of unified resistance.
