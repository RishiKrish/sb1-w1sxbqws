This project presents a detailed, engaging, and historically accurate narrative of India's First War of Independence—often referred to in colonial accounts as the "Sepoy Mutiny." Through this digital storytelling website, we aim to shed light on the true causes, key figures, and the widespread impact of the 1857 uprising from the Indian perspective.

## 📌 Inspiration

The idea was born out of a desire to correct the colonial lens through which the 1857 revolt has long been viewed. We wanted to build something that honors the bravery of Indian leaders, soldiers, and civilians who stood up against oppression.

## 🌐 What It Does

This website guides users through a visual timeline, important events, and the roles played by iconic revolutionaries like Rani Lakshmibai, Mangal Pandey, Bahadur Shah Zafar, and Begum Hazrat Mahal. It helps users understand the context and significance of the revolt through an interactive and informative experience.
